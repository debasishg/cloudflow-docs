A typical Cloudflow application uses the organization shown below. We will implement the example in Scala. Create the following directory structure:

```
   |-project
   |--cloudflow-plugins.sbt
   |-src
   |---main
   |-----avro
   |-----blueprint
   |-----resources
   |-----scala
   |-------sensordata
   |-build.sbt
```

As we move through the process, the leaf level directories of the above tree will contain the following:

* **project/cloudflow-plugins.sbt** : contains the Cloudflow `sbt` plugin name and version.
* **avro** : the avro schema of the domain objects
* **blueprint** : the blueprint of the application in a file named `blueprint.conf`
* **scala** : the source code of the application under the package name `sensordata`
* **build.sbt** : the sbt build script


== The sbt build script

Cloudflow provides sbt plugins for the supported runtimes, Akka Streams, Spark and Flink. The plugins speed development by abstracting much of the boilerplate necessary to build a complete application. You can use multiple runtimes in the same application. In this example, we use only the `CloudflowAkkaStreamsApplicationPlugin` that provides building blocks for developing a Cloudflow application with Akka Streams.

. Create a `build.sbt` file with the following contents and save it in at the same level as your `src` directory:
+
```
import sbt._
import sbt.Keys._

lazy val sensorData =  (project in file("."))
  .enablePlugins(CloudflowAkkaStreamsApplicationPlugin)
  .settings(
    libraryDependencies ++= Seq(
      "com.lightbend.akka"     %% "akka-stream-alpakka-file"  % "1.1.2",
      "com.typesafe.akka"      %% "akka-http-spray-json"      % "10.1.11",
      "ch.qos.logback"         %  "logback-classic"           % "1.2.3",
      "com.typesafe.akka"      %% "akka-http-testkit"         % "10.1.11" % "test"
    ),
    name := "sensor-data",
    organization := "com.lightbend",

    scalaVersion := "2.12.10",
    crossScalaVersions := Vector(scalaVersion.value)
  )
```
+
The script is a standard Scala `sbt` build file--with the addition of the Cloudflow plugin for Akka Streams.

. Add the Cloudflow plugin in `project/cloudflow-plugins.sbt`:
+
```
addSbtPlugin("com.lightbend.cloudflow" % "sbt-cloudflow" % "0.6.0-test-release")
```
